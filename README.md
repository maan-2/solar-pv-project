## 👋 About Me

I'm an aspiring Project Manager with a focus on renewable energy and sustainability. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to manage the full project lifecycle — from planning and budgeting to stakeholder communication and risk control — using a residential Solar PV installation as a case study.

I’m passionate about the energy transition, and I enjoy turning complex project requirements into clear, executable plans. This GitHub space showcases my practical knowledge in:

- 📊 Gantt chart scheduling
- 💰 Budget estimation
- 👥 Stakeholder analysis
- ⚠️ Risk and issue management
- 📡 Communication planning

I'm actively looking to contribute to real-world projects in clean energy, infrastructure, or sustainability-focused initiatives.
